# Better ClearType Tuner
A better way to configure ClearType font smoothing on Windows 10.

## Features

Quickly set font-smoothing settings in Windows 10 and know what you are getting, unlike using the broken ClearType tuner that is built-in to the OS.

[*] Enable or disable font antialiasing.
[*] Choose between Grayscale antialiasing or subpixel antialiasing using RGB or BGR subpixel layouts.
[*] Edit the contrast of font rendering (when using RGB or BGR subpixel antialiasing).
[*] Preview the results at several font sizes and see a zoomed-in view to better-understand what is going on internally!
